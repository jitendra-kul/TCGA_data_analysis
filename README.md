# TCGA_data_analysis

Questions:
Load the TCGA dataset and provide a summary including:
   1. The number of samples per cancer type
   2. The mean and standard deviation of expression levels for each gene
   3. The top 5 most variable genes across all samples

Another question is"Identify the top 10 differentially expressed genes between 5 cancer types using a Kruskal-Wallis test test. Visualize the expression of these genes with a heatmap. (you can make multiple visualization plots)"
